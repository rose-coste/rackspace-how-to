We provide our customers with a private label version of MigrationWiz.
This means that many features that are present in the full version of
MigrationWiz are not readily available. You may use the full version if
you choose to. If you are not looking for the features provided by the
full version of MigrationWiz,
see
[Migrate your email by using the Self-Service
Tool](/how-to/migrate-your-email-by-using-the-self-service-tool)
for the standard steps.

### Benefits of the full version of MigrationWiz

- Designed for power users
- Can run more migration projects at once
- Can show detailed statistics about the migration
- Can stop migrations
- Can show speed and progress of a migration
- Can perform date range migrations
- Can customize migrations
- Can schedule migrations to auto-start

### Support and cost considerations

Before deciding whether to use the full version rather than the private label version,
consider how that choice can affect migration costs and support procedure.

#### Cost differences

When migrating to Rackspace Email and Apps, users will receive
the discounted rate of $4.99 per mailbox only when purchased via
the Private Label Portal at http://rackspace.selfmigration.com.  

If purchasing licenses through http://migrationwiz.com, those licenses
will be listed at the retail price of $11.99 per mailbox.  In order
to take advantage of the discounted rate in the full version of
MigrationWiz, licenses must first be purchased in the Private Label
Portal, then used in the full version.

#### Support differences

Support for the full version of MigrationWiz is available
through MigrationWiz support directly through their [Contact Form](https://www.migrationwiz.com/Public/ContactUs.aspx).

Support for the private label version of MigrationWiz is
available through your Rackspace Email and Apps Support team.
